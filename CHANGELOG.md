# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- **`litellm_key`**: Preserve null `user_id` state when LiteLLM returns the API-injected `default_user_id`, avoiding inconsistent results after apply. ([#109](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/109))
- **`litellm_team_member`**: Treat LiteLLM's `team_member_already_in_team` response as idempotent success during create so Terraform can adopt existing memberships after lost state. ([#110](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/pull/110))

### Verified
- Full Go test suite passes with `go test ./... -count=1`.
- Dev E2E import/apply/no-op/destroy passes for imported keys with API-injected `default_user_id`.
- Dev E2E lost-state re-apply/no-op/destroy passes for existing team memberships.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **`litellm_key`**: Add `project_id` support to the resource and data source, allowing keys to be scoped to LiteLLM projects. ([#105](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/105))
- **`litellm_mcp_server`**: Add `skip_url_validation` to support MCP server URLs that are reachable by LiteLLM but not by the Terraform runner or validation path. ([#108](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/108))
- **`litellm_unified_access_group`**: Add a resource plus single/list data sources for LiteLLM UI/docs Access Groups using the current `/v1/access_group` API. Supports models, MCP servers, agents, assigned teams, and assigned keys. ([#89](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/89))
- Added dev E2E testing workspace and runner for validating provider behavior against a real LiteLLM dev deployment.

### Changed
- **`litellm_mcp_server`**: Change `extra_headers` from `map(string)` to `list(string)` to match the LiteLLM API contract. Includes schema versioning and state migration from the previous map form. ([#106](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/106))

### Fixed
- **`litellm_team`**: Preserve configured nullable budget/member fields when the LiteLLM API omits them on read, while still allowing explicit `null` clears. ([#99](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/99), [#104](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/pull/104))
- **`litellm_key`**: Prevent API-injected default `budget_duration` from being written into state when it was not configured, avoiding inconsistent results after apply.
- **`litellm_user`**: Prevent API-injected defaults (`user_role`, `budget_duration`, `max_budget`, `tpm_limit`, `rpm_limit`) from being written into state when they were not configured.
- **`litellm_agent`**: Preserve omitted optional nested `agent_card` fields/blocks when the API injects defaults, avoiding inconsistent results after apply.
- **`litellm_model`**: Add retry handling for eventual consistency during resource reads and data source reads, unwrap `{"data": [...]}` responses in the data source, and ensure computed attributes are known when create/update read-back is delayed.
- **`litellm_fallback`**: Add retry handling for model-router propagation during fallback create/update/read operations.
- **`litellm_prompt`**: Read prompts from the current `/prompts/{prompt_id}` route, unwrap `prompt_spec` responses, retry read-back for eventual consistency, and preserve null for API-injected defaults on optional-only fields.
- **`litellm_credential`**: Add retry handling for resource and data source reads to tolerate intermittent API read-back after credential creation.
- **List/data source response parsing**: Accept current LiteLLM response shapes for teams, organizations, access groups, guardrails, tags, prompts, models, and tag info responses.

### Verified
- Full Go test suite passes with `go test ./... -count=1`.
- Dev E2E plan/apply/no-op-plan/destroy passes for team, key, user, budget, model, project-scoped key, access group, tag, MCP server, organization, guardrail, search tool, vector store, fallback, team member, team member add, team block, key block, agent, prompt, credential, and list data sources.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **`litellm_user`**: Fix "Missing or invalid Authorization header" error by sending `Authorization: Bearer` header alongside `x-api-key` for all API requests. ([#90](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/90))

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **`litellm_team`**: Add `router_settings` support with `fallbacks` and `context_window_fallbacks` for team-level model fallback configuration. Resolution order: Key > Team > Global. ([#82](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/82)) — thanks @tushar8408

### Fixed
- **`litellm_model`**: Fix inconsistent Terraform state for team-scoped models caused by LiteLLM rewriting `model_name` to an internal value. The provider now prefers `model_info.team_public_model_name` over the top-level `model_name` when reading team-scoped models. ([#84](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/84)) — thanks @antisilent

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **New Resource**: `litellm_agent` — Manage LiteLLM Agents (A2A) with full CRUD support ([#59](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/59))
  - A2A agent card with capabilities, skills, provider metadata
  - Object permissions for MCP servers, models, and other agents
  - Rate limiting (TPM/RPM per-agent and per-session)
  - Static/extra headers configuration
  - Import support via agent ID
- **New Data Source**: `litellm_agent` — Retrieve information about a single agent by ID
- **New Data Source**: `litellm_agents` — List all agents
- Unit tests for agent resource (build request minimal/full, read-back state, Unknown→null resolution)
- Documentation for agent resource and data sources
- **New Resource**: `litellm_project` — Manage LiteLLM Projects with full CRUD support ([#80](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/80))
  - Projects sit between teams and keys in the hierarchy
  - Budget controls (max, soft, duration, per-model)
  - Rate limiting (TPM/RPM global and per-model)
  - Model access, metadata, tags
  - Import support via project ID
- **New Data Source**: `litellm_project` — Retrieve information about a single project by ID
- **New Data Source**: `litellm_projects` — List all projects
- Unit tests for project resource (build request minimal/full, read-back state, Unknown→null resolution)
- Documentation for project resource and data sources

### Changed
- **`litellm_key`**, **`litellm_team`**, **`litellm_organization`**: `metadata` values that contain JSON objects or arrays (e.g. logging configuration) are now sent as native structured data to the API instead of escaped strings. Values are automatically JSON-decoded on write and JSON-encoded on read-back. The schema remains `map(string)` — use `jsonencode()` for complex values. ([#71](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/71))

## [1.2.5] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **`litellm_key`**: Fixed "inconsistent values for sensitive attribute" error when supplying a custom key value. The `readKey` function was unconditionally overwriting `data.Key` with the hashed token returned by `/key/info`, which differs from the raw key the user provided. User-provided keys are now preserved during read-back. ([#79](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/79))

### Added
- Unit tests for custom key preservation during read-back (user-provided key not overwritten by hashed token)

### Contributors
- FalconerTC (`@FalconerTC`) for reporting [#79](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/79)

## [1.2.4] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **`litellm_model`**: Fixed "provider still indicated an unknown value for litellm_model.*.mode" error when using wildcard routing (e.g. `openai/*`). Wildcard routes may not have a `mode` set in the API response, leaving the `Computed` attribute Unknown after apply. The provider now resolves Unknown `mode` to null in `readModel`. ([#70](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/70), [#74](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/pull/74))
- **`litellm_key`**: Fixed 404 "Key not found in database" error on read-back when the key value contains URL-special characters (e.g. `#`). The `#` character was interpreted as a URL fragment delimiter, silently truncating the key before it reached the server. The key value is now percent-encoded with `url.QueryEscape()`. ([#73](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/73), [#75](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/pull/75))
- **`litellm_key`**: Fixed "Provider produced inconsistent result after apply: .key_alias was null, but now cty.StringVal(...)" error when using `service_account_id` without explicitly setting `key_alias`. The `key_alias` attribute is now `Optional + Computed` so the provider can accept the API-defaulted value. ([#76](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/76), [#78](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/pull/78))

### Added
- Unit test for wildcard routing mode resolution (Unknown → null when API returns no mode)
- Unit test for URL-encoding of special characters in key values during `/key/info` requests
- Unit tests for `key_alias` with `service_account_id` (default aliasing, explicit override, Unknown resolution)
- Smoke test configs: `model_wildcard.tf`, `key_service_account.tf`

- FalconerTC (`@FalconerTC`) for confirming [#70](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/70)

## [1.2.3] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- **`litellm_key`**: Fixed provider crash (nil pointer dereference) during state upgrade from schema v0 → v1. The `UpgradeState` handler was calling `req.State.GetAttribute()` which requires `PriorSchema` to be set; since `PriorSchema` was nil, `req.State` was nil and the call panicked. The upgrader now uses `req.RawState.JSON` to read the prior state and `resp.DynamicValue` to write the upgraded state, which work without a prior schema.

### Added
- Unit tests for the v0 → v1 state upgrader covering the happy path (ID is hashed, other attributes preserved), nil `RawState`, empty ID, and invalid JSON inputs.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- checksum mismatch with terraform registry from CI/CD build fixed.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **`litellm_key`**: Fixed "element 0 has vanished" error when using `tags` — the LiteLLM API stores tags inside `metadata["tags"]` rather than as a top-level field in `/key/info`. The provider now checks both locations ([#67](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/67))
- **`litellm_key` data source**: Fixed tags always returning empty — same root cause as above; the datasource now also reads tags from `metadata["tags"]`

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-08

### Security
- **`litellm_key`**: Resource ID no longer exposes the raw API key in plaintext during plan/apply. The `id` is now a SHA256 hash (`sha256:...`), preventing key leakage in CLI output and CI/CD logs ([#66](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/66))
  - Automatic state migration from schema v0 → v1 — no manual action required for existing users
  - Import still accepts the raw key and hashes it automatically

### Added
- **`litellm_key`**: Support for user-defined key values via the optional `key` argument. If not set, LiteLLM generates a key automatically ([#60](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/60))
- Unit tests for hashed ID (determinism, create flow, predefined key, state migration, read-back)
- Documentation for predefined key usage and upgrade notes

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **New Resource**: `litellm_fallback` — Manage model fallback configurations for general errors, context-window exceeded, and content-policy violations ([#62](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/62), [#64](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/pull/64))
  - Supports three fallback types: `general`, `context_window`, `content_policy`
  - Composite ID (`model:fallback_type`) with import support
  - `model` and `fallback_type` force replacement; `fallback_models` can be updated in-place
- **New Data Source**: `litellm_fallback` — Retrieve existing fallback configuration by model name and fallback type
- **Smoke Test Infrastructure**: Added `make local`, `make logs`, and `make smoke` targets with `internal_testing/smoke.sh` for running plan/apply/destroy against a local LiteLLM proxy
- Unit tests for fallback resource (build request, read-back state, empty fallback models, create body)

## [1.0.6] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- **`litellm_model`**: Fixed "Provider produced inconsistent result after apply" for `additional_litellm_params` values containing small decimals — the API returns numeric strings in scientific notation (e.g. `"1.75e-07"`) which didn't match the user's decimal notation (e.g. `"0.000000175"`). Both plan and read-back values are now normalized to canonical decimal form.
- **`litellm_model`**: Fixed "element has vanished" error when `input_cost_per_token` or `output_cost_per_token` are set via `additional_litellm_params` — these keys were incorrectly filtered out on read-back because they appeared in the known-params exclusion list. The filter now respects user-configured keys.
- **`litellm_model`**: Fixed "was null, but now `video_generation`" error for the `mode` attribute — when the user didn't set `mode`, the API-inferred value (e.g. `"video_generation"` for sora-2) was written into state, conflicting with the null plan. Mode is now only populated from the API when the user configured it or it was previously set.
- **`litellm_credential`**: Fixed "Credential not found" warning on create — the read-back immediately after creation could fail with 404 due to eventual consistency. Added retry logic with exponential backoff (matching the existing model resource pattern).

### Changed
- **`litellm_model`**: The `mode` attribute is now `Optional + Computed` (was `Optional` only), allowing the API to populate it during import.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- **`litellm_model`**: Fixed `additional_litellm_params` being silently dropped on create and update — keys like `timeout`, `cooldown_time`, `max_retries` were never sent to the API ([#56](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/56), [#57](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/pull/57))
- **`litellm_model`**: Fixed `readModel()` not unwrapping the `{"data": [...]}` response envelope from `/model/info`, causing state to be empty after read (Pattern 1 from [#53](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/53), missed for this resource)
- **`litellm_model`**: Fixed `tpm` and `rpm` read-back from API-injected defaults causing perpetual drift when not configured
- **`litellm_model`**: Removed `merge_reasoning_content_in_choices` from known params filter so it flows correctly through `additional_litellm_params`
- **`litellm_model`**: Added handling for complex types (arrays, objects) in `additional_litellm_params` read-back via JSON serialization
- **`litellm_model`**: Import now reads all non-known `litellm_params` from the API into `additional_litellm_params`

### Added
- New `convertStringValue()` helper for type-safe conversion of string params to native JSON types (int, float, bool, JSON objects/arrays)
- Unit tests for create, patch, read, import, and type conversion scenarios
- Documentation note about PATCH merge limitation (keys cannot be deleted via update)

## [1.0.4] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **All resources**: Resolved "Provider produced inconsistent result after apply" and "unknown values after apply" errors caused by three systemic bug patterns across the provider ([#53](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/53)):

  **Pattern 1 — API response nesting:** Read functions accessed fields from the top-level response, but the LiteLLM API nests data under wrapper keys (e.g., `/key/info` returns `{"info": {...}}`, `/vector_store/info` returns `{"vector_store": {...}}`). Added unwrapping logic to all affected resources and datasources.
  - `litellm_key`, `litellm_team`, `litellm_organization` (resources and datasources)
  - `litellm_vector_store`

  **Pattern 2 — Else-clause zeroing (`!IsNull()` → `IsUnknown()`):** When the API didn't echo back a field, `else if !data.X.IsNull()` clauses zeroed out user-configured values to empty lists/maps, contradicting the planned value. Changed all such clauses to `else if data.X.IsUnknown()` so concrete config values are preserved.
  - `litellm_organization`: `models`, `tags`, `metadata`, `model_rpm_limit`, `model_tpm_limit`
  - `litellm_mcp_server`: `mcp_access_groups`, `args`, `env`, `credentials`, `allowed_tools`, `extra_headers`, `static_headers`, `tool_name_to_cost_per_query`
  - `litellm_vector_store`: `vector_store_metadata`, `litellm_params`
  - `litellm_key`: `model_rpm_limit`, `model_tpm_limit`
  - `litellm_team`: `model_aliases`, `model_rpm_limit`, `model_tpm_limit`
  - `litellm_model`: `access_groups`

  **Pattern 3 — API-injected defaults appearing in state:** The API returns default values for fields the user never configured (e.g., `budget_id`, `alias`, `allow_all_keys`, `mcp_info`, server-injected metadata keys). These caused "was null, but now has value" errors. Fixed by only setting these fields in state when the user originally configured them.
  - `litellm_key`: `budget_id`, `metadata` (filters server-injected `tpm_limit_type`/`rpm_limit_type`)
  - `litellm_team`: `metadata` (same filtering)
  - `litellm_organization`: `budget_id`
  - `litellm_mcp_server`: `alias`, `description`, `command`, `allow_all_keys`, `authorization_url`, `token_url`, `registration_url`, `mcp_info` block
  - `litellm_guardrail`: `default_on`, `litellm_params`
  - `litellm_vector_store`: `litellm_params` (filters server-injected keys)

- **`litellm_key`**: Fixed scalar `Optional+Computed` fields (`max_budget`, `tpm_limit`, `rpm_limit`, `max_parallel_requests`, `soft_budget`, `blocked`) remaining Unknown after apply when API returned null. Added explicit Unknown-to-Null resolution.
- **`litellm_organization`**: Fixed `blocked` remaining Unknown after apply.
- **`litellm_vector_store`**: Fixed create failing with "`where.vector_store_id`: A value is required" by generating a UUID client-side. Fixed create failing with `'litellm_params'` error by always sending `litellm_params` (even if empty) as the API requires it.
- **`litellm_search_tool`**: Fixed create/update requests not wrapped in `{"search_tool": {...}}` as the API requires. Fixed response parsing to unwrap nested `"search_tool"` key.
- **`litellm_tag`**: Fixed read function to handle changed API response format (`/tag/info` returns `{"tag-name": {...}}` map instead of array).
- **`litellm_key_block`**, **`litellm_team_block`**: Added `UseStateForUnknown` plan modifiers for immutable computed attributes (`created_at`, `created_by`, `key`, `blocked`).

### Removed
- **All resources**: Removed server-side runtime metrics from resource schemas (`spend`, `updated_at`, `status`, `budget_reset_at`, `models_updated`) that change outside Terraform and cause perpetual drift. These remain available in datasources.

### Added
- Regression tests for key and team readback behavior with nested API responses.
- Internal testing infrastructure (`internal_testing/`) with Docker Compose stack (LiteLLM proxy + Postgres 16) and Terraform test files for all 19 resources and 27 datasources.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **`litellm_team`**: Fixed "Provider returned invalid result object after apply" for omitted optional attributes by fully populating all `Optional + Computed` list/map fields in read state (`models`, `tags`, `guardrails`, `prompts`, `metadata`, `model_aliases`, `model_rpm_limit`, `model_tpm_limit`, `team_member_permissions`) ([#53](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/53))
- **`litellm_model`**: Fixed "Provider returned invalid result object after apply" for omitted optional attributes by resolving unknown `access_groups` and `additional_litellm_params` values during readback ([#53](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/53))
- **`litellm_key`**: Fixed incomplete readback for `Optional + Computed` fields that could leave unknown values after apply (`models`, `allowed_routes`, `allowed_passthrough_routes`, `allowed_cache_controls`, `guardrails`, `prompts`, `enforced_params`, `tags`, `metadata`, `aliases`, `config`, `permissions`, `model_max_budget`, `model_rpm_limit`, `model_tpm_limit`) and added update readback refresh.
- **`litellm_mcp_server`**: Fixed nested `Optional + Computed` readback for `mcp_info.mcp_server_cost_info.tool_name_to_cost_per_query` so unknown values are resolved.
- **`litellm_organization_member`**: Fixed `user_id` (`Optional + Computed`) hydration when membership is created via `user_email`, by matching on email during reads and persisting the resolved user ID in state.

### Added
- Regression tests for team/model/key/MCP server readback behavior and organization member matching to ensure optional+computed attributes are always known after apply.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-07

### Changed
- **`litellm_model`**: Aligned `mode` values with the LiteLLM proxy API across validation and documentation. Supported values are now: `chat`, `completion`, `embedding`, `audio_speech`, `audio_transcription`, `image_generation`, `video_generation`, `batch`, `rerank`, `realtime`, `responses`, `ocr`, `moderation` ([#52](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/pull/52))
- **Documentation**: Updated `mode` list formatting in `docs/resources/model.md` for better readability and consistency

### Contributors
- Nick Silva (`@antisilent`) for [#52](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/pull/52)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **`litellm_user`**: Fixed "Provider produced inconsistent result after apply" error when creating a user without specifying `teams`, `models`, or `metadata` ([#51](https://github.com/ncecere/terraform-provider-litellm/issues/51))
- **All resources with optional list/map attributes**: Applied the same null-preservation fix across all affected resources to prevent empty API responses from overwriting null state values with empty collections
  - `litellm_user`: `teams`, `models`, `metadata`
  - `litellm_team`: `models`, `tags`, `guardrails`, `prompts`, `metadata`, `model_aliases`, `model_rpm_limit`, `model_tpm_limit`, `team_member_permissions`
  - `litellm_organization`: `models`, `tags`, `metadata`, `model_rpm_limit`, `model_tpm_limit`
  - `litellm_key`: `models`, `allowed_routes`, `allowed_passthrough_routes`, `metadata`, `allowed_cache_controls`, `aliases`, `config`, `permissions`, `model_max_budget`, `model_rpm_limit`, `model_tpm_limit`, `guardrails`, `prompts`, `enforced_params`, `tags`
  - `litellm_tag`: `models`
  - `litellm_model`: `access_groups`, `additional_litellm_params`
  - `litellm_mcp_server`: `mcp_access_groups`, `args`, `env`, `credentials`, `allowed_tools`, `extra_headers`, `static_headers`, `tool_name_to_cost_per_query`
  - `litellm_credential`: `credential_info`
  - `litellm_vector_store`: `vector_store_metadata`, `litellm_params`

### Changed
- All optional list and map attributes across all resources are now marked as `Optional + Computed` instead of `Optional` only, allowing the provider to correctly manage state when these attributes are omitted from configuration

### Added
- Unit tests for null-preservation logic validating correct behavior for list and map attributes

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **Complete Provider Rewrite**: Migrated from terraform-plugin-sdk to terraform-plugin-framework v1.17.0
- **19 Resources**: model, key, key_block, team, team_block, team_member, team_member_add, mcp_server, credential, vector_store, organization, organization_member, user, budget, tag, access_group, prompt, guardrail, search_tool
- **26 Data Sources**: Single and list versions for all resources (model/models, key/keys, team/teams, etc.)
- **`litellm_model`**: Added `access_groups` field to assign models to access groups for team/key-based access control
- **New Resources**:
  - `litellm_budget` - Manage budget configurations
  - `litellm_tag` - Manage tags for cost tracking
  - `litellm_access_group` - Manage access groups for model access control
  - `litellm_prompt` - Manage prompt templates
  - `litellm_guardrail` - Manage guardrails for content moderation
  - `litellm_search_tool` - Manage search tools for RAG
  - `litellm_organization` - Manage organizations
  - `litellm_organization_member` - Manage organization memberships
  - `litellm_user` - Manage users
  - `litellm_key_block` - Block/unblock API keys
  - `litellm_team_block` - Block/unblock teams
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Added examples/ directory with minimal, complete, multi-provider, data-sources, mcp-servers, and search-tools configurations

### Changed
- Provider now uses terraform-plugin-framework for improved type safety and better Terraform integration
- Reorganized provider code into internal/provider/ package structure

## [0.3.16] - 2025-12-01

### Added
- `litellm_key`: Support service account keys (calls `/key/service-account/generate`), `allowed_routes`/`allowed_passthrough_routes`, and auto team-all-models default when `team_id` is set without `models`. (Issues #32, #28 context)
- `litellm_model`: Allow `mode = "batch"` for batch-capable models. (Issue #37)
- `litellm_team`: Metadata now accepts nested maps/lists instead of string-only values. (Issue #38)

### Fixed
- `litellm_model`: Added a safer post-create read retry that treats transient 404/not-found responses as retryable instead of clearing state, reducing "inconsistent result after apply" errors under concurrent creates. (Issue #41)

### Fixed
- `litellm_key`: Preserve state/readback for new key fields; optional fields remain backwards-compatible.
- `litellm_team_member_add`: Removing `max_budget_in_team` now clears the budget instead of setting it to `0`, avoiding accidental lockouts. (Issue #36)
